    The red panda is one of the most fascinating and endangered animals in the world. Native to the temperate forsts of the Himilayas and southwestern China, these charming creatures are known for their striking reddish-brown fur and bushy ringed tails. The Akron Zoo is proud too be part of the conservation effort to protect this incredible species through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Species Survival Plan.
