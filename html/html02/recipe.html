    <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>1 cup</strong> (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</p>
    <p><strong>3/4 cup</strong> granulated sugar</p>
    <p><strong>3/4 cup</strong> packed brown sugar</p>
    <p><strong>2 large</strong> eggs</p>
    <p><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> vanilla extract</p>
    <p><strong>2 1/4 cups</strong> all-purpose flour</p>
    <p><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> baking soda</p>
    <p><strong>1/2 teaspoon</strong> salt</p>
    <p><strong>2 cups</strong> semi-sweet chocolate chips</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Step 1: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. <em>Do not overmix</em>.</p>
    <p>Step 2: Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</p>
    <p>Step 3: In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined.</p>
    <p>Step 4: Stir in the chocolate chips.</p>
    <p>Step 5: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, or until edges are nicely browned. <em>Remove from the oven while the centers still look slightly soft</em>.</p>

    <h2>Chef's Notes</h2>
    <p>To ensure chewy cookies, measure your flour correctly by lightly spooning it into the measuring cup. Chilling the dough for 30 minutes can also help prevent the cookies from spreading too much. <mark>For the best texture, always use room temperature butter.</mark></p>
